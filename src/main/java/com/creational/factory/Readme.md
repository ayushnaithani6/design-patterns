This Java program provides a simple example of a 
Dynamic Database Connection Manager using the 
Factory Design Pattern. The program includes classes for MySQL and PostgreSQL database connections, 
along with a manager class (DynamicDBConnectionManager) that dynamically 
returns a database connection based on the provided name of Database.
