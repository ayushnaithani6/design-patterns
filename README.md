# Design Patterns

Before we explore the intricacies of design patterns, I kindly recommend that you take a moment to review the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section located at the end of this Readme. It provides answers to questions regarding the contents of this repository and offers guidance on how to make the most efficient use of this resource.

## What are Design Patterns ?
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a way to solve problems that software developers frequently encounter when designing and building applications. Think of them as proven blueprints or templates that guide you in creating well-structured, flexible, and maintainable software.

To understand what are design patterns, let's use an analogy. Imagine you want to build a house, but you're not sure how to go about it. You consult an architect who presents you with various house design patterns. These patterns are based on years of experience and knowledge of what works best in different scenarios. Each design pattern describes a specific solution to a common architectural problem, such as organizing rooms, maximizing space utilization, or optimizing energy efficiency.

Similarly, in software development, design patterns provide guidance on how to structure and organize code to solve common problems effectively. They capture the best practices and expertise of experienced developers. Design patterns are not specific to a programming language or framework; they are abstract concepts that can be implemented in different contexts.

## Why Design Patterns are important ?
By applying design patterns, you can benefit from the collective knowledge and experience of the software development community. They promote code reusability, maintainability, and extensibility while helping you solve common design problems effectively.

**Note:** It's important to know that design patterns are not strict rules to follow blindly. They are guidelines that can be adapted and tailored to fit your specific needs. As you gain experience in software development, you'll encounter and recognize these patterns more frequently, allowing you to apply them in your own projects.


## Types of Design patterns
Design patterns can be categorized into three main types: creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.

### Creational patterns
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, helping you create objects in a flexible and reusable manner. 

When you write code, you often need to create objects. Creational design patterns provide you with ready-made plans and techniques for creating those objects in a smart and reusable way.

The following design patterns fall under the category of Creational Design patterns:

| Status                  | Name             | Frequency of Use |
|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| <input type=checkbox /> | Factory          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐            |
| <input type=checkbox /> | Abstract Factory | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐            |
| <input type=checkbox /> | Singleton        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐             |
| <input type=checkbox /> | Prototype        | ⭐⭐⭐              |
| <input type=checkbox /> | Builder          | ⭐⭐               |

### Structural patterns
Structural patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects, helping you form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.

When you write code, you often encounter situations where you need to deal with multiple classes and objects that need to work together. Structural design patterns provide solutions for organizing and structuring these classes and objects in a way that promotes flexibility, efficiency, and code reusability.

The following design patterns fall under the category of Structural Design patterns:

| Status                          | Name      | Frequency of Use |
|---------------------------------|-----------|------------------|
| <input type=checkbox checked /> | Facade    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐            |
| <input type=checkbox />         | Adapter   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐             |
| <input type=checkbox />         | Composite | ⭐⭐⭐⭐             |
| <input type=checkbox />         | Proxy     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐             |
| <input type=checkbox />         | Bridge    | ⭐⭐⭐              |
| <input type=checkbox />         | Decorator | ⭐⭐⭐              |
| <input type=checkbox />         | Flyweight | ⭐                |


### Behavioral patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with the interaction and communication between objects, enabling you to define how objects collaborate and fulfill various responsibilities.

The following design patterns fall under the category of Behavioral Design patterns:

| Status                  | Name                    | Frequency of Use |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| <input type=checkbox /> | Iterator                | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐            |
| <input type=checkbox /> | Observer                | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐            |
| <input type=checkbox /> | Command                 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐             |
| <input type=checkbox /> | Strategy                | ⭐⭐⭐⭐             |
| <input type=checkbox /> | State                   | ⭐⭐⭐              |
| <input type=checkbox /> | Template Method         | ⭐⭐⭐              |
| <input type=checkbox /> | Chain of Responsibility | ⭐⭐               |
| <input type=checkbox /> | Mediator                | ⭐⭐               |
| <input type=checkbox /> | Interpreter             | ⭐                |
| <input type=checkbox /> | Memento                 | ⭐                |
| <input type=checkbox /> | Visitor                 | ⭐                |

## FAQs
### What does this repository contains?
This repository contains most important and frequently used design pattern, categorized into three main types: creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.

**Note:** This resource is in development phase, so There is checkbox before each design pattern representing whether it is covered or not. 


### How to get started ?
1. First step would be to go through this Readme file to understand what are design patterns and why you should use them.
2. Types of design patterns section contains design patterns categorized into three main types: creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.
3. Let's say you want to know about any specific design pattern e.g. Abstarct Factory, 
   1. Since Abstract factory is part of Creational Design pattern, so go to CreationalPatterns > AbstarctFactory > Readme.md
   2. Each design pattern has well written Readme with example and code.
4. If you are just following full resource go through each design pattern based on **Frequency of use** starting from Creational, then Structural followed by Behavioral. First cover all design pattern having 5 ⭐ and 4 ⭐ in Frequency of use. This way you will get a good idea what each type contains and how categorization is done.

**Note:** You don't need to learn anything, just go over concepts, take rough idea, and save this repository and whenever you feel like you can use a particular design pattern to solve any particular usecase just refer.
